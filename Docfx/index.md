# HuduAPI Client
This is a C# library in the very early stages of development. It provides an easy to use framework to work with the HuduDocs API using strongly typed objects and parameters.
For more information on Hudu Docs, please visit https://www.hudu.com/ .

If you do use this library and find issues or have suggestions on making it better please create an issue on the [GitHub](https://github.com/dracon80/CSharp-HuduAPI-Client) repository.

## Overview:
The library provides an [EndPoint](reference/HuduAPI.Endpoints.html) for each of the possible Hudu Restful API endpoints,
along with [paramater objects](reference/HuduAPI.Endpoints.Parameters.html) and associated builders to make building parameter sets easier. Once the parameters are built you can call the associated method and get the returned values from Hudu.


Please see the [Tutorials](tutorials/intro.html) page for examples of how to use the lilbrary.
